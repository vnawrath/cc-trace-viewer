Please implement phase $ARGUMENTS of `implementation-plan.md`.
When you are finished with the implementation, reflect your progress in the implementation plan document. But do NOT mark the phase as complete yet. Instead, give me instructions to test and verify the solution manually.
Limit the instructions to only the minimum that needs to be validated by a human. Every test that you can do programatically, please do it yourself.
Write the tests to be performed by human into a single checklist, one checkbox line per test and save it as test-plan-$ARGUMENTS.md. Make the test plan as concise as possible - 5-8 checkbox lines max, no headings or descriptions.
Do not include the manual test checkboxes in the implementation plan.
