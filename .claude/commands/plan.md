Please help create an implementation plan to achieve the goal described in goal.md.
Read goal.md, then inspect the codebase to understand the current implementation, relevant files, functions, fields and API that will be relevant to the plan.
Use subagents to offload the research work.
Then write the plan into implementation-plan.md, with general overview and further broken down into individual implementation phases.
Each phase should be deliverable on it's own, with a clear verifiable and testable outcome. Phases should be rougly equal in scope and effort.
For every phase, you should:

- Include all relevant context you found, with links to the files.
- Include checkboxes to track completion progress of every phase.
- List steps to verify and test that the phase was completed correctly.

Before you write down the plan, summarize this for me in a very concise way. Keep this to only key design points of the plan. If a decision needs to be made, provide numbered questions with short, lettered options and let me decide. Let me review the plan and answer the questions, and only then write everything down into the file.
