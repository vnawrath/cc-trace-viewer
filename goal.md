Create a starter repo for a Typescript Vite + React + Tailwind + React Router project.
The project will be named CC Trace Viewer. It will eventually become a request explorer, so we can structure the starter repo in this way too.
It should have a home page, a page for listing requests for a given session, and a detail page of a request.
Do not provide any data or UI yet, just the repo structure and setup, with stub pages to show everything is working correctly.
