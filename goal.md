We need to do two things, in no particular order:

- we need to show a plot of all the costs of all the sessions above the sessions list, bucketed by date (using the startTime of the session)
- we should show a sidebar, similar to what we have on the other pages, that shows the total cost, the total duration (API), and the total token counts across all the sessions
