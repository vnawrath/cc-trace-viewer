We need to re-design the frontend of this application to be much more usable.
This should be an app for professionals, so it needs to be very information dense and easy to navigate.
The core design principle should be "Whitespace is the enemy".
We should turn the app to dark mode.
On the session list, we should just make it a table, with the name of the session and the most important metrics.
On the session detail, the overview should be moved to a side, and the main content should be a table of request.

- Again this should only show the most important metrics of the request
- The filtering form needs to be hidden away by default
- The request should be sorted by timestamp, but the oldest should be on top

On the request detail, we should again move the request details to the side, and the main content should be the list of messages and the agent response.

- the request and response headers can be ommited
- raw request data and response data can be moved to separate tabs, same as the tool definitions

Make sure to use the frontend-design skill when creating the new design.
